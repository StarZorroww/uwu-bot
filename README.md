# uwu-bot
Discord bot I have been developing to learn more about js and discord.js

**You will need**
- A PC\
- [Discord bot application](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html)
- [npm/node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

**Installation**\
Installing is simple. Download this repository as a zip file and open it. Then open a new command window and `cd` to the zip folder (make sure it's extracted).
Once complete, type `npm i`in the root directory. Then simply do `node main.js`. You are finished and your bot has started!
